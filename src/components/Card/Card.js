        Dear [Prospectâ€™s Name], <br /> <br />I hope this email finds you well.
        My name is Ricky Carruth, and I'm a licensed real estate agent in the
        City of Chicago. I recently tried to reach you by phone to discuss your
        real estate needs, but it seems you were unavailable...
